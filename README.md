# Tinder-Swipe-Right

This project uses the Python Selenium package to automate the process of swiping right on Tinder profiles and sending a pre-defined opening message. The program uses the Chrome web driver, so the user must provide the path to their local driver executable. 
The program will launch the Tinder website and automatically start swiping right a specified number of times. If a match is found, the program will send a pre-defined message to the match. If a match is not found, the program will dismiss any pop-up messages that may appear. The user can customize the opening line and the number of swipes to fit their needs.
